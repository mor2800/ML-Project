# Classification and Unsupervised Analysis of Online Sports Wagering Activity in Connecticut

## Project Overview

This project applies supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze monthly online sports wagering activity reported by licensed operators in the state of Connecticut. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns in wagering behavior and distinguishing between high- and low-revenue periods using financial and regulatory data.

## Project Objectives

* Formulate a binary classification task to predict high vs. low gross gaming revenue months
* Compare supervised learning models under random and time-based evaluation strategies
* Explore behavioral patterns using clustering techniques
* Detect anomalous months with unusual wagering activity
